											<h3>Experience with Technology</h3>
											<p> My interest in Computers started with my dad. He has years of experience doing a variety of Computer Science oriented
       											jobs and has taught me a lot of what I know. In High School, I learned three different coding languages from different classes: HTML, Visual Basic and Java Script.
												I learned HTML from an after school coding class I took in 9th grade, and I learned Visual Basic and Javascript from Computer Science classes I took.
            									I then joined a pilot class called Cyber Security in 12th grade. We were tasked with completing labs on securing systems to prevent hackers from accessing it.
												Overall, these experiences have made me develop an interest in the field and I now wish to pursue it as a career! I am currently enrolled
                                                at Mount Allison University to get a Degree in Science with a major of Computer Science</p>

											<h3> Cyber Titan</h3>
											<p> In 2019, I joined a competition with a team of 5 other people. We were in the Cyber Titans cybersecurity competition
 											    held in Ottawa after winning top 10 in Canada! At the competition, we got a bunch of input from people who have years of experience in the Cyber Security field</p>

											<h3>Drama</h3>
											<p>Starting in 2016, I have been in the Moncton High School Drama department ever since. I started out by doing props and sets, bringing out needed props in between each scene.
											    In 2017, I started to do the tech for shows, juggling between the lights and the mics. In 2019, we brought two shows to Dramafest at the St.Thomas university. One show I did the lights for, and the other I actually made my first
  												 performance in! I have been deeply invested in Drama since the beginning and have loved doing it each and every year.</p>

											<h3>Volunteer</h3>
											<p> For 17 years, I lived in Irishtown New Brunswick. When I lived there, I volunteered at various different events hosted by
											    our community center. We had events like Easter breakfasts, Haunted Houses at Halloween and we held dances for youth in the area. While in school, I also
												did a sort of volunteer work in a class. I was enrolled in a class called "Reading Tutor." In this class, we had to teach
												refugess and people from different countries to read and write in English. We had to make our own lesson plans as to
												what we would teach our tutees each day</p>
